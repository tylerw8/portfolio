        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I was born in Ogden, Utah.  I have studied Psychology, Human Factors, and Information Science.  I have worked as a User Researcher, Interaction Designer, and dabble in Business Analyst type work.  I have taken classes in Basic, Fortran, Pascal, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, and dabbled in HTML 5, CSS, and Javascript on my own.  I am taking this class to become as the recruiters call it "a unicorn."  Someone who is skilled in front end development, as well as interface design and user experience.</p>
